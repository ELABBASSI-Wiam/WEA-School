            <h3>Professional Teachers</h3>
            <p>Our courses at the WEA School of Fashion aim to train the key figures of the fashion supply chain, thus
              ranging from the creative to the strategic field, from the organizational to the commercial aspects, from
              marketing to image and communication activities. In this direction, the School of Fashion teaches its
              students to "live" and "feel" fashion, in its entirety and in every single part, an interaction of
              perspectives and a mix of professional figures.

            </div>
            <h3>Quality Education</h3>
            <p>It is in this context that the WEA School of Fashion examines the connections of fashion with the
              cultivation or production of raw materials, with the production and printing processes of yarns and
              fabrics, with traditional and industrial manufacturing, with the management of waste, with the upcycling
              phenomenon, or with projects aimed at recovering precious archives and vintage garments.

            <h3>Always on Time</h3>
            <p>We have abandoned the era of speech in favor of a rapid and synthetic language made up of images that
              need to be constructed and inserted into digital media. Also the product ideation and design phases are
              moving towards virtual worlds that require specialized technical skills. At the same time, in the real
              world, the fashion industry asks its managers to understand what the needs of its target are, in order to
              maintain or increase market shares and find the right position in the pyramid that goes from luxury to the
              mass market.

            <h3>We keep pace with the times</h3>
            <p>In recent years the fashion product has become as important as the imagery it brings with it. People
              don't just buy an object but a lifestyle, a way of thinking or behaving. A dress helps to become aware of
              who we are and brings with it issues related to both identity and freedom of expression. In this regard,
              Styling can provide added value by proposing stories that can amplify the messages deriving from a
              collection, a fabric or an idea.

            <p>Rome boasts centuries of history in the field of fashion: it spans periods ranging from the Etruscans to
              Roman times, all the way to the present day with the evolution of the concept of contemporary fashion. If
              fashion design is your passion and you want to spend the summer in the city of the “Grande Bellezza”, then
              our Summer Course in fashion Design Lab is the perfect choice for you. </p>
            <p>This course is open to everyone, and no specific requirements are needed. It will be the task of our
              highly specialized teachers to introduce you to the basics. What we ask of you is
              curiosity and dynamism: together with your fellow students, you will explore Rome and its iconic sites.
              This is where you will experience the layering of different periods in the art, architecture, and history
              of the Eternal City. During this journey, you will immerse yourself in the world of design, from
              the basics to workshop techniques.
              As a centre of inspiration for research, this city will contribute to the development and refinement of
              design techniques through creativity as well as innovation. The Final Project will consist in the
              creation of your personal piece and a digital presentation of your experience in Rome.</p>
